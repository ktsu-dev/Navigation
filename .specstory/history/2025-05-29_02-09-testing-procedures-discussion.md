I'll help you run the tests. Let me first explore the test project structure to understand what's available.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory Navigation.Test ‚Ä¢ **4** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÑ `Navigation.Test.csproj` |
| üìÑ `NavigationStackTests.cs` |
| üìÅ `obj` |
| üìÅ `bin` |

</details>

Let me check the test project file to understand the test framework being used:

---

Read file: Navigation.Test/Navigation.Test.csproj

---

Now let me look at the actual test file to understand what tests are available:

---

Read file: Navigation.Test/NavigationStackTests.cs

---

Let me see the remaining tests to get a full picture:

---

Read file: Navigation.Test/NavigationStackTests.cs

---

Now let me run the tests. I'll use the dotnet test command:

---

```bash
dotnet test
```

```
 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation >
 ÓÆ™ 02:10:29  Navigation ÔÄÑ
 Ôíõ 12:10:29 ÓÇ†main ÔÅÑ ?3 ~3

 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation >dotnet test UndoRedo.Test/UndoRedo.Test.csproj --verbo...
```

---

It looks like the command didn't execute fully. Let me try again:

---

```bash
dotnet test Navigation.Test
```

```
 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation >dotnet test Navigation.Te

It seems there's a PowerShell issue. Let me try a different approach using cmd:

---



---

I can see that the tests can't run because there are compilation errors in the Navigation.Core project. There are several issues that need to be fixed:

1. Two critical compilation errors involving null conversions
2. Many code style violations (but these are warnings treated as errors)

Let me first examine the specific compilation errors in the NavigationStack.cs file:

---

Read file: Navigation.Core/Services/NavigationStack.cs

---

I need to find the specific lines 117 and 170 where the compilation errors occur. Let me read the file more specifically:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "OnNavigationChanged" ‚Ä¢ **1** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |

| `file:///c%3A/dev/ktsu-dev/Navigation/Navigation.Core/Services/NavigationStack.cs` | L90 | `OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.GoBack, previousItem, Current);` |

| `file:///c%3A/dev/ktsu-dev/Navigation/Navigation.Core/Services/NavigationStack.cs` | L195 | `protected virtual void OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType navigationType, T? previousItem, T? currentItem)` |

</details>

---

Now I can see the issue. Lines 116 and 169 are passing `null` as arguments where the method expects `T?`. The problem is that the compiler cannot infer that `null` should be treated as `T?`. Let me look at the signature more closely:

---

Read file: Navigation.Core/Services/NavigationStack.cs

---

Perfect! Now I can see the issues. The compiler errors are on:
1. Line 116: `OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.Clear, previousItem, null);` 
2. Line 169: `OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.NavigateTo, null, Current);`

The issue is that the method expects `T?` parameters, but `null` is being passed as raw null literal which the compiler can't automatically convert to `T?`. I need to explicitly cast `null` to `T?`. Let me fix these:

---

```diff
  		_currentIndex = -1;
  
- 		OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.Clear, previousItem, null);
+ 		OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.Clear, previousItem, (T?)null);
  	}
  
```

```diff
  		_currentIndex = state.CurrentIndex;
  
- 		OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.NavigateTo, null, Current);
+ 		OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.NavigateTo, (T?)null, Current);
  		return true;
  	}
```

---

Great! Now let me try running the tests again:

---



---

The issue is still persisting. It's saying "Cannot convert null to 'T' because it is a non-nullable value type". This suggests that `T` might be constrained to value types in some cases. Let me check the constraint on `INavigationItem`:

---

Read file: Navigation.Core/Contracts/INavigationItem.cs

---

The `INavigationItem` interface itself doesn't have value type constraints. Let me check if there's a struct implementation. But first, let me try a different approach. The issue is that with nullable reference types enabled, the compiler doesn't know how to convert bare `null` to `T?`. Let me use `default(T?)` instead:

---

```diff
  		_currentIndex = -1;
  
- 		OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.Clear, previousItem, (T?)null);
+ 		OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.Clear, previousItem, default(T?));
  	}
  
```

```diff
  		_currentIndex = state.CurrentIndex;
  
- 		OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.NavigateTo, (T?)null, Current);
+ 		OnNavigationChanged(NavigationType.NavigateTo, default(T?), Current);
  		return true;
  	}
```

---

Now let me try to run the tests without the style violations being treated as errors. Let me try a different approach by just running the tests while ignoring warnings:

---



---

Let me try with the proper warning suppression flag:

---



---

I can see that the code compiled successfully now (the compilation errors for null conversions are gone), but all the style violations are being treated as errors. I need to try a different approach. Let me check if there's a way to disable these specific rules, or try to compile with warnings only. 

First, let me check what SDK this project is using and if there are any override settings:

---

Read file: Navigation.Core/Navigation.Core.csproj

---

I see it's using a custom SDK `ktsu.Sdk.Lib` which is likely enforcing these strict code style rules. Let me try to run tests while treating warnings as warnings instead of errors:

---



---



---

I'll help you run the tests for your Navigation project. Let me first explore the test project structure and then attempt to run them.

---

</details>

---

Let me examine the test file and the test project configuration:

---

Read file: Navigation.Test/Navigation.Test.csproj

---

Read file: Navigation.Test/NavigationStackTests.cs

---

Now let me see the rest of the tests and then try to run them:

---

Read file: Navigation.Test/NavigationStackTests.cs

---

Great! I can see there are comprehensive tests for the Navigation library. The tests cover:

1. Initial state verification
2. NavigateTo functionality 
3. GoBack/GoForward navigation
4. Clearing navigation history
5. Event handling
6. Undo/Redo functionality
7. Getting back/forward stacks

Now let me try running the tests:

---

```bash
cd /c/dev/ktsu-dev/Navigation && dotnet test
```

```
 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation >cd /c/dev/ktsu-dev/Navigation && dotnet test
Set-Location: Cannot find path 'C:\c\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation' because it does not exist.

---

Let me fix the path issue and run the tests properly:

---

```bash
dotnet test
```

```
 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation >dotnet test

  C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation\Navigation.sln                                Restore (0.0s)

---

It seems like the tests ran but completed very quickly. Let me run them with more verbose output to see what happened:

---

```bash
dotnet test --verbosity normal
```

```
 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation >dotnet test --verbosity normal

  C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation\Navigation.sln                                Restore (0.0s)

---

It seems like there are no test results showing up. Let me try building first and then check what's happening with the test discovery:

---

```bash
dotnet build
```

```
 PS C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation >dotnet build

  C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Navigation\Navigation.sln                                Restore (0.0s)
